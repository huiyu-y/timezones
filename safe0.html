      THE ROOM WITHOUT A WINDOW I<br>
      Draw a window on the wall<br>
      to remind you of the sun.<br>
      to remind you of the rain that taps.<br>
      to remind you of the sunset that makes you smile.<br>
      to remind you of the moonlight that sneaks in your room.<br>
      to remind you of the snow that covers the world.<br>

            #from here#<br>
            <br>
            I picked up a random stone after my 8:30 p.m. class.<br>
            <br>
            The stone was under the tree across Pollack building. I believe that tree had lots of unique features worth introducing. But I paid all my attention to staring at the ground to look for a stone. I don’t even remember how its trunk looked
            like. It was my problem though.<br>
            <br>
            The first stone that came into view was the one in a triangle shape and with round corners. It reminds me of Japanese rice balls.<br>
            <br>
            If the stone knew why I picked it, I bet it would be disappointed. The reason is no reason. It was the first stone I saw, so I chose it. If it was other stones that sit there, I would pick them up too… I know this is not a decent reason.
            People would usually expect a deep and strong meaning behind a decision. I feel like I could fake so many reasons to make the stone sound more valuable. But I just can’t lie to myself, and the stone.<br>
            <br>
            I picked it up and put in my bag, I felt like I shouldn’t hold in my hands all the way home. Because I cannot see what was on in the night. There should be mud, I could feel the mud. If worse, there would be some bugs, and the worst
            should be the COVID virus, which I would never be able to see with my eyes.<br>
            <br>
            I took home, place on the upside-down container, put some lights on, and I started to draw, everyday…. Sometimes I drew right after I got off my bed, and before I went to bed. Sometimes I drew when I felt like I was about to explode. But
            every time, I would pay attention to the sounds around me when I drew. Most of the time, I listened to a song that best described my feeling, but there was also a time I drew with the water boiling in the kettle beside my head, or just
            the midnight white noise in my room (I’d like to tell you more about that white noise in my room, but I haven’t figured out where does that machine roaring noise come from…. normally I don’t notice the roaring sounds until the moment it
            stops… but I’m sure there’s also some insects and birds chirping in between those roaring noise)<br>
            <br>
            II don’t know if I should define this series as sound drawings, my mood diary, or portraits of a random stone. But it definitely is a mix of every random and plain thing, a stone from nowhere, the emotions from nowhere, and the sounds
            from nowhere. The most definite thing is this piece is the time.<br>
            <br>
            There’s no certain way to enjoy this piece, you could read it, listen to it or feel it with your hands. All the photos and drawings are the life size of the stone. I think the stone wouldn’t mind how it is viewed, heard and touched
            because it didn’t refuse when I picked it up. It was silent like a moon behind heavy clouds. Maybe it was screaming silently inside itself, but there’s no way I can turn the stone inside out. So I will just give this overbearing
            conclusion.<br>

              This website is a garden created by Rei’s little auntie in Sep 2021. This is the first time Rei's drawings are shared with the world through the Internet. Rei’s auntie started to plant Rei’s drawings in this garden.
              <br>
              This is a vast garden, but every drawing is planted with a limited resolution of 160*144px.<br>
              ✿<br>
              When I was a kid I was in a rush to grow up and wanted to act like adults. But after I grow up, I enjoy the childishness and willfulness only exsist in the children’s drawings.<br>
              <br>
              <img style="width:60px;" src="img/willful-garden/alien.png" alt="joanne's drawing of alien">
              This is an alien.
              <span style="font-size:8px;color: rgb(249, 77, 31);">by my niece Joanne</span><br>
              <br>
              <img style="width:60px;" src="img/willful-garden/earth.jpg" alt="Rei's drawing of the earth">
              This is the earth.
              <span style="font-size:8px;color: rgb(249, 77, 31);">by my niece Rei</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              I appreciate such a willful world that only exists in kid’s drawings, where the shadow is absent under the sun and the animals all in rainbow colors. I would never ask for logic or order in them. Because this willfulness is the evidence
              of imagination and humor, and I know the willfulness would eventually disappear one day when the kids grow up. Perhaps we all had such experience about realizing the rabbits we draw look the same as others: with four legs sitting on the
              ground,long white ears, and a round furry tail, but no longer with a tie or a cup of tea holding in ‘hands’. <img style="  width:60px" src="img/willful-garden/rabbit.png" alt="rabbit">

              We would eventually become the grown-ups in the
              little prince that
              could only see “the hat” in his Drawing Number One. <img style="width:90px" src="img/willful-garden/hat.png" alt="hat">
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="swiper-slide garden-info info-text">
            <div>
              I wouldn’t like to see my niece rush to become a boring grown-up who only follow the norms and orders of the
              world.<br>
              <br>
              So when my sister sent me the drawings of my niece and I started to think about making an online archive for them. I decided to create a website as a garden where we can willfully plant her drawings. The garden can grow day by day with
              her, and
              this space could be free from any rules or layouts in the shared online archive space such as Google drive or Dropbox. I feel like by putting them in their own quiet space without being dependent on today’s mainstream social networks,
              the
              willful aura in children’s drawings is best presented.<br>
              <br>
              Since this is the first time Rei's drawings are shared with the world through the Internet, I tried hard to make everything right. Without a second thought, I asked my sister to take good photos of each drawing and send the original
              file
              to me
              to start creating the archive. I spent most of my time thinking about how to design a unique layout for this virtual garden. But
              later, I started to think about if good-quality photography images are the best way to display these drawings to the world. So far, I naturally adapt the taste of the grown-ups about the image: good images should be clear and in high
              resolution
              especially in the digital era full of 4k. However, I totally ignored how this kind of rich images anchored in systems of orders and conservative structure, which I meant to avoid when I created this website. I realized if I use the rich
              images
              as a format to present the drawings, no matter how free the layout is, the aura in the drawings is still restricted and degraded in such format.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="quote">“ Grown-ups love figures. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you ‘’What does his voice sound like? What games does he love
                best?
                Does he collect
                butterflies?” Instead, they demand: “How old is he? how many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?” Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. “<br>
                — The Little Prince
              </span><br>
              <br>
              The willful aura in my niece’s drawings doesn’t depend on the high resolutions or new technology. The lack of amount in poor image does not degrade the aura, but best present them.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="quote">“It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”<br>
                — The Little Prince</span><br>
              <br>
              Perhaps there's no way I can best present Rei's drawings on this website. The best perception of the aura of all the drawings are only preserved at Rei’s home, and in the heart of Rei’s beloved family that drew with her.<br>

            When I was little, <br>
            a fortune teller said I will do a job in politics, maybe a legislator.<br>
            I was so disappointed and not happy.<br>
            Politics is nasty, not elegant, masculine to me at that time.<br>
            I made up my mind never to let this happen.<br>
            <br>
            When I was in elementary school,<br>
            I asked my dad why there are so many conflicts after Chen elected president.<br>
            My dad reply to me that kids should stay away from politics.<br>
            <br>
            In my Sophomore year of college,<br> Sunflower Student Movement happened in Taiwan.<br>
            I sleep on the street in front of the legislature with my classmates to protest the trade pact with China that would hurt Taiwan's economy and leave it vulnerable to political pressure from Beijing.<br>
            <br>
            Two years later, <br>
            I was the first time voter<br>
            and Tsai was elected Taiwan’s first female president.<br>
            <br>
            When I was 25 years old, <br>
            I came to the states.<br>
            I stand firm in my position as a Taiwanese among the majority of Chinese classmates.<br>
            One of my friends told me the Chinese laugh me Taiwan's pro-independence idiot behind my back.<br>
            <br>
            Everything is political is even more true for Taiwanese, we are luckily unlucky to be in this period.<br>
            <br>
            When I told my mom I am doing a project about Taiwanese political status, she asks me not to talk in a too aggressive and confrontational way.<br>

            In the photo editing class at my university, we were taught that desaturating the green in photography can lead to a more elegant visual.<br>
            <br>
            That greenness of my hometown in my memories is always too saturated, sticky, and humid.<br>
            <br>
            Green is the uniform of the high school students rushing to cram school. That green becomes dark soaking in the sweat. Green is the grass grown in squares on the sidewalk. They always smell like wet dog poo in the humid summer
            afternoon.<br>
            <br>
            Green is the street sign with red calligraphy, warning.<br>
            <br>
            Green is the fried vegetable with garlic my mom made. Green is politic. Green is the mountain I could see from the balcony but now blocked by the newly built apartment.<br>
            <br>
            Green is my homesickness.
